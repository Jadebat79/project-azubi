## Security Implementation

### Multi-Layer Security Approach

#### 1. Network Security
- **HTTPS Everywhere:** TLS 1.2+ encryption for all communications
- **CORS Protection:** Restricted origins and methods
- **Domain Restrictions:** API access limited to approved domains

#### 2. Data Protection
- **Private Storage:** S3 bucket blocks all public access
- **Encryption at Rest:** SSE-S3 (AES-256) for all stored files  
- **Encryption in Transit:** TLS for API Gateway and S3 communications
- **Time-Limited Access:** Pre-signed URLs expire after 1 hour (configurable)

#### 3. Access Control
- **IAM Least Privilege:** Granular permissions with prefix-scoped S3 access
- **Role-Based Security:** Lambda execution role with minimal required permissions
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive request sanitization and validation

#### 4. Audit and Compliance
- **Access Logging:** CloudTrail integration for all AWS API calls
- **Application Logging:** Structured CloudWatch logs with correlation IDs
- **Data Retention:** Automatic cleanup policies for compliance

## Cost Analysis

### Pricing Model
The platform uses a pay-per-use model with transparent cost structure:

| Usage Tier | Monthly Requests | Estimated Cost | Primary Cost Driver |
|------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Low** | 100 requests | $8/month | Hosting & baseline services |
| **Medium** | 10,000 requests | $252/month | Amazon Polly character processing |
| **High** | 100,000 requests | $2,400/month | Polly + increased data transfer |

### Cost Optimization Features
- **Automatic Cleanup:** S3 lifecycle policies prevent storage cost accumulation
- **Efficient Caching:** Voice metadata cached to reduce API calls
- **Format Options:** Multiple audio formats for bandwidth optimization
- **Engine Selection:** Standard voices available at 50% cost reduction

---

## Operational Excellence

### Infrastructure as Code
**Technology:** Terraform with modular architecture  
**Environments:** Development, Staging, Production  
**Features:**
- Complete environment reproducibility
- Version-controlled infrastructure changes  
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Environment-specific variable management

### Monitoring & Observability
**Metrics Tracked:**
- Application performance (latency, errors, throughput)
- Business metrics (synthesis requests, popular voices)
- Cost tracking (per-service usage and billing)
- Security events (access patterns, failed requests)

**Alerting Strategy:**
- **Critical:** Lambda errors >5%, API Gateway 5xx >1%
- **Warning:** High latency, cost threshold breaches
- **Info:** Usage pattern changes, new voice popularity

### Deployment Pipeline
```bash
# 1. Infrastructure Deployment
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply

# 2. Frontend Deployment  
cd tts-web
npm run build
# Automatic via Amplify Git integration

# 3. Validation
curl -X GET https://api-endpoint/voices
curl -X POST https://api-endpoint/synthesize
```
